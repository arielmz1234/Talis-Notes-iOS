# Progress

## How to pick this up

1. Read `BRIEF.md`, `PLAN.md`, this file, `OWNER_TODO.md`.
2. `gh run list -L 3` (GitHub CLI at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`), then look at the last run's
   screenshots: `gh run download <id> -n screenshots -D <scratch dir>`. Landscape iPad screenshots
   come out sideways (rotate them when reviewing; the test's attempt to upright them may not work).
3. There is no Swift on the Windows PC; every compile happens in CI (about 15–20 minutes with
   screenshots, macOS runners sometimes queue). Batch changes, and read compile errors with
   `gh run view <id> --log-failed | grep error:`.

## Session 1 (10 Nov 2026, the owner's Windows PC)

Environment: Windows, no Swift or Xcode locally, Docker not running. CI on GitHub Actions
(`macos-15`, Xcode 16.4). The repo is public, so its macOS minutes are free.

Done:
- Repository set up: BRIEF, PLAN, OWNER_TODO, XcodeGen `project.yml`, `Packages/TaliCore`, CI
  (core tests, build, screenshots on iPad light/dark/Hebrew and iPhone light/dark, unsigned .ipa).
- TaliCore (pure Swift, tested):
  - `Pt`, `Rect`, `Affine` (Android's field names and `then` order), `Geo`, `Pages`
    (A4 layout, clip rules, page reorder helpers).
  - The library model: `NotebookMeta`, `Folder`, `DocKind`, `PaperStyle`, covers, sort,
    natural order, numbered names, greeting.
  - `NotesDb`: SQLite3 with the Android schema VERSION 8 and its upgrade steps.
  - `InkCodec`: androidx.ink's stroke storage (gzip'd protobuf, delta-coded runs), worked out
    from a real Android stroke (fixture in the tests) and written the same way.
  - `Gzip`, `CRC32`, `Deflate` (Apple's Compression), and `Zip` reader/writer.
  - `BackupArchive`: write/restore the Android backup .zip, with merge (newer wins, nothing
    deleted, older schemas, names kept apart).
  - `Lasso` geometry.
  - Ported tests: MovePageTest, FreeNameTest, LassoTest, FreeSelectTest, plus page layout,
    database, ink, zip and backup round trips.
- App:
  - Theme: lilac light/dark, variable fonts (Figtree, Bricolage, Heebo, Vazirmatn with weight
    axes), the cloud surface (bumps ported exactly), sky clouds, papers (all eight built-in ones).
  - Library: sidebar, phone drawer, search, sort, cards, folders, Recently deleted, context menu,
    new-notebook card, Backups card (save a backup file, restore files).
  - Notebook: `NoteCanvas` is a PKCanvasView. PencilKit draws the live stroke; each finished stroke
    is stored as an Android ink row. Strokes that run off their page are hidden past it with
    PencilKit's stroke mask. Pages are drawn by a CATiledLayer underneath. Writing on the last page
    adds a page. Pens (fineliner, fountain, pencil, calligraphy, highlighter) with a panel for type,
    colour and thickness; PencilKit's eraser and lasso; undo and redo.
- Strings: 827 keys in six languages generated from Android.
- App icon from `tools/icon-source.png`.

Verified (CI run 42853258304, screenshots looked at):
- Core tests pass (20 at the time).
- The library on iPad (landscape, portrait, dark, Hebrew mirrored with the sidebar on the right)
  and iPhone (light, dark). The sky, clouds, cloud surfaces and cards look as intended.
- Found and fixed after that run (fixes not yet seen in a screenshot):
  - Fonts weren't loading (wrong bundle path).
  - Paper previews faded to blank at small sizes; the landscape card preview was split.
  - The new-notebook card overflowed on iPhone.

Not verified yet: everything from the commit "Writing with Apple Pencil…" onward (canvas, pens,
backups card). See the next CI run.

Next:
- Check the canvas screenshots; fix compile errors if any.
- Ink look: PencilKit's inks differ from Android's brushes. Compare and tune widths.
- Shapes, pictures and text from Android backups are kept in the database but not shown yet:
  port `ItemCodec` and `model/Shapes.kt` next, so restored notebooks show everything.
- Our own lasso (move, resize, copy, delete with the selection menu), page overview, top bar ⋯ menu.
- Settings card (theme, colour families, minimal, language), then iCloud.

Decisions:
- The bundle id is `com.tali.notes`, the same as Android (Apple's ids are separate).
- Swift Testing (`import Testing`) for TaliCore tests.
- Ink: PencilKit for live drawing and display (Apple Pencil latency, zoom, tiling for free), with
  the Android ink format as the stored truth. A PKStroke's control points are stored as the
  Android inputs. Pressure = force / 2; tilt = π/2 − altitude; orientation = azimuth.
  Dashed line styles will need our own rendering later (PencilKit has no dashes).
- World units = points at zoom 1 (Android's dp).

Known problems:
- After a lasso move, the moved strokes are swapped for their stored form, so the lasso selection
  ends (PencilKit's lasso). Our own lasso will replace it.
- New strokes are kept as PencilKit drew them until reopened (control points ≈ samples); strokes
  loaded from Android go through PencilKit's spline, so they look slightly smoother than on Android.
